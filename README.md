Kafka with Spring Boot Tutorial
In this simple and practical project, our goal is to learn the fundamentals of Apache Kafka using Spring Boot.
We have implemented a basic Producer and Consumer that can send and receive messages both as plain text (String) and as JSON objects.

Key Features:
Setting up Kafka and connecting to it via Spring Boot

Implementing a Producer to send messages to a specific Kafka Topic

Implementing a Consumer to receive messages from the same Topic

Supporting sending and receiving of both text and JSON messages

Using standard Kafka configurations in the application.yml file

Displaying sent and received messages in the console for clear understanding of the workflow

This project helps beginner developers get familiar with Kafka concepts easily and enables them to apply it in real-world applications.
It also provides a solid foundation for learning advanced topics like big data processing and distributed systems.
